DSO 562: Fraud Analytics - 2021 Spring - USC Marshall - Prof. [Stephen Coggeshall](https://www.marshall.usc.edu/personnel/stephen-coggeshall)

Final Score: A

### Course Description
This course is about how to build the analytics side of fraud detetion model systems, which covers all algorithmic aspects of solving a fraud problem, in particular how to approach and design the algorithmic solution.

**Main Content**:
- fraud detection processes, fraud detection and prediction models using various statistical techniques, data sources to consider, and evaluation metrics of successful fraud analytics models

- techniques to rank based on probabilities of suspicious activity that helps humans optimize the cost of investigation and confirmation process of fraud

### Project Description
In these two projects, we used tools and developped code to deep dive on **real world** public datasets, detect and predict fraud activity.

Project #1: [Identity Fraud Detection](https://github.com/siqinyan/Fraud_Anlytics_Projects/blob/main/projects_shared/DSO%20562%20Project%202/Project2_Report_Application_Fraud.pdf)

Project #2: [Transaction Fraud Detection](https://github.com/siqinyan/Fraud_Anlytics_Projects/blob/main/projects_shared/DSO%20562%20Project%203/Project%203%20Report.pdf), [slides](https://github.com/siqinyan/Fraud_Anlytics_Projects/blob/main/projects_shared/DSO%20562%20Project%203/PPT.pdf)
